### Why this Repo?

To get hired into any of the top tech companies, one needs to clear the rigorous Data Structure and Algorithms interview followed by System Design interview. Hence, 
to enhance my skill as a programmer and to increase my opportunity to get hired in the big tech, I am writing down blogs on DSA and solving [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/) problems.

Blogs: [Data Structure and Algorithm](mayurji.github.io/data-structure-algorithms/)

LeetCode: [Solving DSA](https://leetcode.com/Mayur-jain/)
